Simple web application that displays the weather of the current user location. There are 2 versions of this app. One built on ReactJS library and another in jQuery. Functionality remains the same with a bit of differences in UI.

## APIs used

+ The [Open Weather API](http://openweathermap.org/) is used to access the weather details of the cities. 
+ [IP-API](http://ip-api.com/) is used to obtain details of the current user location 
+ [GeoBytes](http://geobytes.com/) API is used to obtain locate other cities that the user searches for.


1. Install the dependencies in the project directory

``` sh
$ npm install
```

2. Build the application

``` sh
$ npm run build
```

3. Run the app

``` sh
$ npm run start
```

That is it. Enjoy!
